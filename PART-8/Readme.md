# DeepLearning 

### I came to know working process behind the NeuroScience for Deep learning.

And then Understand the working process of Human brain.
  > Human brain
    *Neuron's
    *Dendrites
    *Axon

### And understand the consept behind technological based approach of NeuroScience for Deep Learning.

And here understand the consept of each and every layer in Neural Network.
    *Input layer
    *synapse(weights)
    *hidden layer
    *output layer
    
And mainly understand function behind the activation function.
    *Threshold Activation function
    *Sigmoid Activation function
    *Rectifier Activation function
    *Hyperbolic Tangent(tan h) Activation function
    
    AND THEN I HOPE I HAVE UNDERSTAND THE BASIC CONSEPT OF DEEP LEARNING UP TO NOW.
